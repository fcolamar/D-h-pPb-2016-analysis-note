In this note, we present the analysis of azimuthal correlations of D mesons and primary charged $\pi$,K,p,e,$\mu$ performed in the ALICE central barrel in p-Pb collisions at $\rm{\sqrt{s_{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV, from 2016 data taking. The analysis is performed in an extended $\pt$ range and with additional observables with respect to p-Pb 2013 data analysis. After a description of the analysis strategy, corrections and systematic uncertainties, the results obtained for prompt $\Dzero$, $\Dstar$ and $\Dplus$mesons in different ranges of transverse momentum of the D meson and of the associated particles are presented. The results are then compared to Monte Carlo models and also with published 2013 p-Pb analysis results for the common $\pt$ ranges. 
The first section of the note deals with the centrality-integrated analysis; the second is focused on the analysis as a function of the ZNA centrality.
