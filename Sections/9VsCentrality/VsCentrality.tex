\subsection{General information}
In the following section of the note, the D-h correlation analysis as a function of the ZNA centrality (in 0-20\%, 20-60\%, 60-100\% classes) is presented, and the results, aiming to be approved as preliminaries for the QM2018 approval session, are presented.
The goal of the analysis is to investigate possible modifications of the correlation peak features (in terms of associated yield and width) among the various centrality classes, which could point toward a different fragmentation and hadronization of the charm quark at different collision centralities.
The possibility of studying the D-meson v2 by subtracting low-multiplicity form high-multiplicity events (vith V0A estimator) was also checked, but the available statistics resulted to be too low for such a study. Therefore, this latter study will not be shown here.
The analysis procedure, corrections applied and systematic uncertainty evaluation for the D-h correlation analysis versus centrality are very similar on what was done for the centrality-integrated. For this reason, the description of the analyses will not be repeated (we will refer to paragraphes of the previous section), but only the differences and the peculiarity related with the centrality slicing will be addressed.
All the relevant figures related to procedure, corrections, systematics and results will anyway be shown in the following.
