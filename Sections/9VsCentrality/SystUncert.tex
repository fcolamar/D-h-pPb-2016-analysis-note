\subsubsection{Uncertainties on fit observables}
The evaluation of the systematic uncertainty on the fit observables is exactly the same as that described in subsection 5.3 for the centrality-integrated analysis (but considering, of course, in each centrality class the corresponding uncertainty values, as described in the previous section).
The only modification involves the values chosen for the $v_2$ hypothesis (also dealt in subsection 5.3), which are differentiated on the bases of the centrality class.
The hypotheses on the charged particle $v_2$ versus centrality were guessed on the bases of the results shown in Fig. \ref{fig:v2h}, taken from the analysis note on charged hadron $v_2$ in p--Pb collisions (2016 sample) in different V0A multiplicity classes. Though the estimator is different from the ZNA we use, the rather flat values of $v_2$ versus centrality ensures the possibility of using these results as reference.

The hypotheses on D-meson $v_2$ were guessed starting from ALICE preliminary results of heavy-flavour decay electron $v_2$ in the same collision system, using the ZNA estimator (left panel of \ref{fig:v2D}. The measurement was performed in lower $\pt$(e) ranges, but which by chance are fairly similar to the average $\pt$ of out D-meson correlation ranges, if the $\pt$ of the parent D-hadron is considered for charm-origin heavy-flavour decay electrons - as shown in the right panel of Fig. \ref{fig:v2D}. The drawback of this choice relies in the fact that these $v_2$ values are obtained after the HM-LM subtraction, while in our analysis we need hypotheses for $v_2$ in each CC (considering this, we used just flat values in each CC following the charged particle trend), and also in the fact that heavy-flavour electron $v_2$ includes the contribution from, beauty-hadron decay electrons (though small for $\pt < 3$ GeV/$c$), while the B-feed-down is instead subtracted in our D-meson analysis.

In the following, thus, we enlist the $v_2$ hypotheses we adopted for the evaluation of the systematic on the fit observables due to a possible presence of flow:
\begin{itemize}
  \item For 0-20\%: 0.08, 0.08, 0.04, 0.02 (for $\pt$(D) 3-5, 5-8, 8-16, 16-24 GeV/$c$); 0.08, 0.05, 0.11 (for $\pt$(assoc) $>0.3$, 0.3-1, $>1$ GeV/$c$)
  \item For 20-60\%: 0.08, 0.08, 0.04, 0.02 (for $\pt$(D) 3-5, 5-8, 8-16, 16-24 GeV/$c$); 0.08, 0.05, 0.11 (for $\pt$(assoc) $>0.3$, 0.3-1, $>1$ GeV/$c$)
  \item For 60-100\%: 0.08, 0.08, 0.04, 0.02 (for $\pt$(D) 3-5, 5-8, 8-16, 16-24 GeV/$c$); 0.10, 0.06, 0.13 (for $\pt$(assoc) $>0.3$, 0.3-1, $>1$ GeV/$c$)
\end{itemize}
